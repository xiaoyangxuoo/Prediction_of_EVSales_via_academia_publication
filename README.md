# Prediction_of_EVSales_via_academia_publication

## Objective


This work's objective was to establish a metric for understanding the impact that a technical paper has over the sales and improvements of electric vehicles. By using a non-linear model our main goal was to predict the number of electronic vehicles that will be sold in the coming years after the paper is released.  Understanding future vehicle sales will allow vehicle manufacturers to know the number of vehicles that will need to be produced in a given year.

## Dataset
The independent variable was the time series of technical publications that are related to lithium ion batteries technologies. Publish or Perish 7 software were used to extract the data. The second variable “dependent variable” was the time series of include electric, hybrid electric, and plugin hybrid vehicles which were gathered from AFDC.Gov. 

## Methodology
Therefore, we decided to approach the problem from a different perspective using Deep Neural Network models (DNN). By using this model, we will be able to make a prediction with a higher level of accuracy using several variables. This way our already stablished objective has been accomplished.
